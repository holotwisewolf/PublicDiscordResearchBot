# Research Discipline Rules

## Core Principles

1. **Falsify before optimizing** - Try to break your hypothesis before refining it
2. **One variable at a time** - Isolate what you're testing
3. **Document failures** - Failed experiments are valuable data
4. **No post-hoc rationalization** - If it failed, it failed

## Before Any Experiment

- [ ] Is the hypothesis falsifiable?
- [ ] What result would disprove it?
- [ ] Is this the cheapest test possible?

## After Any Experiment

- [ ] Log the result in Canon
- [ ] Update assumptions table
- [ ] If failed: move to Refuted Ideas
- [ ] If succeeded: what's the next test?

## Red Flags (Stop and Reconsider)

- "Let me just tweak this parameter..."
- "It almost worked, so..."
- "The data must be wrong..."
- "This time it will be different..."
