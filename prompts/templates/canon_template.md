# Project Canon: [Your Research Domain]

> **This is the single source of truth.** Give only this document to future AI sessions.

---

## 0. Purpose of This Canon
This document is the **single source of truth** for the project.
- It preserves validated thinking
- It records rejected paths explicitly
- It defines what the system can and cannot do
- It allows future sessions (human or AI) to reload context quickly

Raw chat logs are non-authoritative.

### How to Use This Canon
1. **Only update when something is proven wrong or validated**
2. **Every new experiment must reference which section it tests**
3. **Any future AI session should be given only this document as context**

## 1. Core Thesis (Current, Standing)

> [Write your main research hypothesis here]

The project studies:
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]
- [Topic 3]

Goal: [What are you trying to achieve or discover?]

## 2. Definitions & Mental Models (Accepted)

### 2.1 [Term 1]
- Definition and explanation
- How it's used in this project

### 2.2 [Term 2]
- Definition and explanation
- How it's used in this project

---

## 3. What the Model Can Do (Explicitly Allowed)
- [List what your research/system CAN do]
- [Be specific]

---

## 4. What the Model Cannot Do (Explicitly Rejected)
- [List what your research/system CANNOT or SHOULD NOT do]
- [Be specific about limitations]

---

## 5. Research-First Stance

This project is **research before build**.

Any implementation must:
- test one foundational assumption
- aim to falsify, not confirm
- be willing to discard the idea cleanly

A weak but real edge is acceptable.
False confidence is not.

# TRACKING & EXPERIMENTS

## Foundational Assumptions (Kill Targets)

| ID | Assumption | Status | Tested In |
|----|------------|--------|-----------|
| A1 | [Your first assumption] | `UNTESTED` | Phase 1 |
| A2 | [Your second assumption] | `UNTESTED` | Phase 2 |
| A3 | [Your third assumption] | `UNTESTED` | Phase 3 |

**Status values:** `UNTESTED` → `TESTING` → `SUPPORTED` / `REFUTED` / `NARROWED`
