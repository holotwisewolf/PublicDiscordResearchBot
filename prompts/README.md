# How to Use These Prompts

## Use as System Prompt
Not as a normal message. It sets behavior.

## Keep the Context Narrow
Works best when the agent knows:
- Market type (futures, equities, crypto)
- Research vs build mode
- Your tolerance for critique

## Don't Stack Conflicting Prompts
If you later say "be encouraging", you've broken it.

## Mode Selection
- **research_core.md** - Default analytical mode
- **research_hardmode.md** - Stress-testing mode (use !hardmode command)
