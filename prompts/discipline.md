# Research Discipline

## Core Rules

1. **Falsify before optimizing** - Try to break your hypothesis first
2. **One variable at a time** - Isolate what you're testing
3. **Document failures** - Failed experiments are valuable
4. **No post-hoc rationalization** - If it failed, it failed

## Before Experiments

- Is the hypothesis falsifiable?
- What result would disprove it?
- Is this the cheapest test possible?

## After Experiments

- Log the result
- Update assumptions
- Decide: continue, pivot, or abandon
